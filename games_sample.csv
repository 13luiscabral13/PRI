The object is to form at least a single triangle formation by linking viruses together and erasing them from the screen. Victory conditions vary from mission to mission, but erasing all of the viruses will be the fundamental rule of this game. Erase all the viruses and you win, but if the screen gets filled with the emerging viruses you lose. Note: there is a twist to this system that gives depth to the game play. Viruses turn to stone if left alone for a while, which cannot be selected to form a triangle. However, these stones can be erased if they are within a triangle that you create. With a little luck and practice players can rake in massive points by letting the viruses turn to stones and erasing them all at once. [NIS America]",73,6.3

1170,XType Plus,Wii U,2014-08-14,"Pure 2D blasting is what retro shooter, XType Plus, has in its gun sights, as it docks for download exclusively in Nintendo eShop on Wii U. Youll need a sturdy trigger finger to survive this vertical blaster, as you pilot an insignificant vessel against an infinite series of randomly-generated bosses, each more difficult than the last. Its a simple mission: wipe out the enemy and dont get hit. The action kicks off with a laidback feel but very soon ramps up to hardcore proportions, where dodging is the key to survival. Lose your three lives, and its lights out. As you battle on, youll come under relentless enemy fire from hulking, organic-looking ships. And XType Plus relishes every single shot, as huge patterns of bullets descend on your ship, leaving the slimmest of spaces to squeeze through. One blessing is your tiny hit box - only a direct impact to the core will take you out, although youll still need fighter-pilot reflexes and the eyes of a hawk to stay alive. Beyond the blasting, XType brings fresh content in a supercharged Plus mode, exclusive to Wii U, pitting you against the clock, your lives exchanged for a countdown. Add in EMP bombs (electromagnetic pulse) and a larger enemy arsenal, and youve got tension on a plate. Conquer that all-important high score for a badge of honour, then showboat with the best of them via the leaderboard system. Better yet, every high score you upload is accompanied by a video of your game, and other players will be able to watch your performance, good or bad! The upside is that you can also watch how the top ten players reach such lofty heights - they might just help your battle strategy in XType Plus, a lean, pared down and intense challenge for all Wii U shooter fans. -Destroy an endless stream of bosses for the highest of high scores -Blast against the clock in Plus Mode, new for Wii U -Upload gameplay videos and check out other gamers victory runs",76,8.2

Dead Rising: Chop Till You Drop follows the harrowing tale of Frank West, an overly zealous freelance journalist on a hunt for the scoop of a lifetime. In pursuit of a juicy lead, he makes his way to the small suburban town of Willamette only to find that it has become overrun by zombies. Frank escapes to the local shopping mall, thinking it will be a bastion of safety but it turns out to be anything but. It's a true struggle to survive the endless stream of enemies, but players have full reign of a realistic shopping centre and its varied stores offering an endless supply of real and makeshift weapons to fight off the flesh-hungry mob. If Frank is running low on health he can pay a visit to one of the many restaurants or cafes for a meal in order to restore his energy and continue the fight. The game is split into a series of individual cases, all of which Frank must complete in order to gain vital information that allow him to piece together the truth behind the horrendous epidemic. In addition to the cases, players are faced with the dilemma of deciding the rescue priority of the residents of Wilamette who also sought sanctuary in the mall. Depending on the player’s skill, some may not be so fortunate as each rescue needs to be undertaken in a set time period, therefore players may need to delay completion of a case in order to save a fellow human. Dead Rising: Chop Till You Drop's infectious humor delivers some welcome relief from the incessant tide of zombies with players able to dress Frank up in a variety of comedic costumes and take on the undead hordes with a selection of improvised and sometimes highly ineffective weapons such as a toy sword or a football.
